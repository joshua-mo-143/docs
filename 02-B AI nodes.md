## AI nodes
AI nodes allow you to harness the power of AI via any of our supported providers to be able to quickly and effectively return a response from a prompt into your canvas.

## Currently supported types
The following AI node types are supported:

| Name         | Description                                                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Agent        | An all-in-one node with notepad, prompt crafting and response views |
| Vision Agent | An AI agent with image processing capabilities for visual analysis  |

To add one to your workflow, simply drag it onto your canvas and one will be added for you where you dragged it.

To use this node type, you need to click into the Settings (the gearbox icon on the top right of your node) and then change the Model and API credentials to your requirements. `<Find out more in our Credentials article.>` 

Any given AI node can take input from other nodes (via a connector on the left hand side), as well as passing its output to the input of another node.
## Options
While customising your AI agent, you have a number of options to be able to truly make an agent node tailored for your workflow. 

### MCP tools
While creating your agent, you can additionally give it MCP tools that it can then use to calculate the output. For example: imagine giving your agent access to a tool that can search for a list of podcasts, or pull some highlights from your Readwise account.

By using MCP tools, you gain an infinite number of possibilities that you can carry out with your workflow.
