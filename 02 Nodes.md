## What is a node in Arc Studio?
A node in Arc Studio (or more specifically, the canvas) can be considered a unit of functionality in a given workflow. From our node palette, you can currently get several different types of nodes - primarily, input, output, AI (LLM prompting) or MCP (Model Context Protocol). 

Nodes can be joined together to create workflows by connecting them through the input connectors which are located on the left side of any given node that supports input, as well as output connectors which are located on the right side of any given node type that supports output.
