## What is a node in Arc Studio?
A node in Arc Studio (or more specifically, the canvas) can be considered a unit of functionality in a given workflow. From our node palette, you can currently get several different types of nodes - primarily, input, output, AI (LLM prompting) or MCP (Model Context Protocol).

Nodes can be joined together to create workflows by connecting them through the input connectors which are located on the left side of any given node that supports input, as well as output connectors which are located on the right side of any given node type that supports output.

## The anatomy of a node
Nodes have the following anatomy:
- Node connectors (represented as small rounded rectangles)
  - Input and output connectors are always on the left and right, respectively.
  - Relevant connectors will only appear if it's supported by the node type.
- An option to change the node settings in the top right corner of the node (the gear icon)
- An X to delete button in the top right of any  given node.
