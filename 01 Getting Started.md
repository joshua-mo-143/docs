Welcome to **Arc Studio** - your AI assisted canvas for turning ideas into clarity. Whether you're planning a project, doing research or team collaborating, Arc Studio helps you think better, faster.

## What is Arc Studio?
Arc Studio combines a flexible visual canvas with powerful AI support. Think of it like a whiteboard that understands you â€” you can drop in ideas, documents, tasks, or prompts, and our AI helps connect the dots, organize your thoughts, and even suggest the next steps.

## Before you start...
Below are some helpful things we suggest you use with Arc Studio to ensure your experience is as smooth as possible.
- A modern web browser (we recommend Chrome or Firefox)
- A quiet place to think (let Arc Studio handle the rest!)

You will also need an Arc Studio account. [Sign up here.](#)
## Creating your first canvas
Below are the steps you'll need to create your first Arc Studio workflow:
- Make sure you're logged in via `<TODO>` using one of the supported sign-in providers.
- The first page you'll arrive at is the dashboard home where you can view all your workflows. To create a new one, click "New Workflow", then a pop-up menu asking for a name and description should appear. Fill out the details and then hit Create to create your first workflow!
- You should now be your workflow canvas, where you can try things out yourself or check out some of our other documentation pages to get up to speed quickly on some easy workflows.
