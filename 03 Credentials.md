## What are credentials?
Within Arc Studio, whenever you need to use an AI node you will be required to store an API key from your chosen platform. We call your stored API keys "credentials".

## How do I add credentials?
Follow the steps below to add credentials to your Arc Studio account:
- Navigate to the Settings page on the top right of your page.
- The Credentials section should be at the top of the Settings page.
- To add a credential, click "Add credential". Give it a name/description and then paste in your API key.

Once done, your credential should now be listed as a pre-existing option in your Credentials menu.
